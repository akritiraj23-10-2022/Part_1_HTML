If the security breach at the Bhabha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group milwOrm didn’t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this: James Davis aka jdavis_4, a resident of <B><FONT Face="Comic Sans MS" Color=RED> www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483 </B></FONT> homestead community on the Internet, might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing, or exchanging it with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!<BR/> Surprised?
